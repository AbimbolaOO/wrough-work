      <h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>
        We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the
        European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy
        we are going to explain exactly how and why this data is collected, and
        how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used
        in the wrong way.
      </p>

      <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
      <p>
        GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU
        residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the
        EU residents have, over their personal data. The GDPR is relevant to any
        globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU
        residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they
        are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our
        baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
      <p>
        Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR
        covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or
        in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.
        Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some
        examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic
        data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
        orientation, and ethnicity.
      </p>

      <h2>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and
          transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would
          reasonably expect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose
          and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must
          specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its
          purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal
          data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data
          be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
      <p>
        GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect
        individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises
        the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater
        fines for breach. Beyond these facts, it's simply the right thing to do.
        At Locumspace, we strongly believe that your data privacy is very
        important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in
        place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights
        requirements of GDPR. Locumspace processes or stores all personal data
        in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and
        personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which
        case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and
        Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be
        able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve, and
        remove personal data. Our customer support team is here for you to
        answer any questions you might have about working with the API.
